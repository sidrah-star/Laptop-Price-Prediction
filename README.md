# 💻 Laptop Price Analysis  
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis | Visualization | Machine Learning | Web Deployment

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of laptop specifications and prices to identify key factors affecting laptop pricing.  
The main goals were to understand market trends, visualize patterns, and build a predictive model.

## ✅ Key Highlights
- Collected and cleaned data (handled missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Performed EDA using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**
- Identified important features affecting price (e.g., **Processor**, **RAM**, **SSD**, **Brand**)
- Built and evaluated machine learning models using **Scikit-learn**  
  (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Deployed the price prediction model using **Flask** to create a user-friendly web interface
